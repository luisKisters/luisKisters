# Hi there 👋

**Luis Kisters** - **18-year-old** | Full Stack Developer & Growth Specialist [Narratic AI](https://www.narratic.ai/) | Public Relations & IT [WaldorfSV](https://waldorfsv.de/)

I'm amazed by the always evolving technology and a passionate learner. I have a passion for effecting positive change and am currently contributing my skills to WaldorfSV as part of the Education Policy Section, focusing on Public Relations & Tech. I also work at Narratic Labs as a Full Stack Developer & Growth Specialist. I believe in actions speaking louder than words and encourage you to judge me based on my deeds.

## 🧠 About Me

My journey began in 9th grade at [Freie Waldorfschule Kreuzberg (FWSK)](https://www.waldorfschule-kreuzberg.de/), where I learned the core skills that now drive my work. I am active at [Waldorf Landesschüler:innenvertretung (W-LSV) of Berlin and Brandenburg](https://www.waldorf-berlin-brandenburg.de/die-lag-berlin-brandenburg/schuelerinnenvertretung) and [WaldorfSV](https://waldorfsv.de/). As a Board Member and Delegate at [W-LSV](https://www.waldorf-berlin-brandenburg.de/die-lag-berlin-brandenburg/schuelerinnenvertretung), I contribute to the education policy section. At [WaldorfSV](https://waldorfsv.de/), I'm happily working to transform the aspects I always wanted to change at Waldorf.

I gained enriching experience during an internship at Gärtnerei Rengoldshausen, learning the value of dedication and embracing long hours. I also gained practical tech experience at Muli Technologies GmbH, honing teamwork, programming, and UX testing skills. While I discovered my love for collaboration, I found remote work wasn't my forte at that point. I was hired at Narratic Labs at 17 and consider it a 'dream job'.
